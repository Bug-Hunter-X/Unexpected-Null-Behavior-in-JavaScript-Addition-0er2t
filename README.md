# Unexpected Null Behavior in JavaScript Addition

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in JavaScript related to null checks and addition.

## The Bug
The `foo` function aims to add two numbers. It correctly handles cases where either `a` or `b` is `null`. However, real-world applications might have more complex null checks needed to prevent unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates a more robust handling of null values, showing various strategies for ensuring data integrity before performing mathematical operations.
